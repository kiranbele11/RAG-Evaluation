{"id":"1cc39c33-0de3-4635-94f2-248ddecb6056","question":"What are they?","reference_answer":"On Day 4, you'll learn how to version and deploy models, deal with deployment tradeoffs, serve predictions using different strategies, use human-in-the-loop workflows, and apply cost-sensitivity to improve model performance. Additionally, you'll learn about pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to compress models and optimize their performance in real-world applications.","reference_context":"Document 3: backtesting, invariance, and behavioral testing. You'll learn how to frame evaluation metrics in the context of business goals and ensure models work in real-world scenarios. Aditionally, you'll learn to prevent data leakages, test for fairness, perform error analysis, and work with imbalanced data.Day 4 - How To Serve Model Predictions (In A Clever Way)In this session, you'll learn how to version and deploy models and deal with deployment tradeoffs. You'll learn different strategies for serving predictions, using human-in-the-loop workflows, and using cost-sensitivity to improve model performance. Additionally, you'll learn about pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to compress models and optimize their performance in real-world applications.Day 5 - How To Monitor A Model (Drift Is Awful)In this session, you'll learn how to handle edge cases and outliers, address feedback loops, and detect distribution shifts like covariate shift, label shift, and concept drift.
