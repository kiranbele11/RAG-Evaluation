You&#x27;ll learn how to approach new projects, frame complex problems, ask the right questions during discovery, deal with selection bias, and approach data collection and labeling using active learning and weak supervision.Day 2 - How To Build A Model (That Works)In this session, you&#x27;ll explore data cleaning and feature engin...\",\"backtesting, invariance, and behavioral testing. You&#x27;ll learn how to frame evaluation metrics in the context of business goals and ensure models work in real-world scenarios.
